## Philosophy

MarkText is still in development, many things will change and features will be added but our philosophy is to keep things clean, simple and minimal. For example our side bar and tabs: these two panels provide a lot of functionality but don't disturb the user if it's need it. We'll add more and more features, maybe extended it by plugins, that can be activated via settings to improve MarkText. So we allow everyone to customize MarkText for their needs and provide a minimal default interface.

## Issue reporting guidelines

Please search for similar issues before opening an issue and always follow the [issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md). Please provide a detailed description of the problem in your PR and live demo or screenshots are preferred.

## Pull request guidelines

Please make sure the following is done before submitting a PR:

- Submit PRs directly to the `develop` branch.
- Reference the related issue in the PR comment.
- Utilize JSDoc for better code documentation.
- Ensure all tests pass.
- Please lint (`yarn run lint`) and test your PR before submitting.
- All PRs need to pass the **CI** before merged. If it fails, please try to solve the issue(s) and feel free to ask for any help.

If you add new feature:

- Open a suggestion issue first.
- Provide convincing reason to add this feature.
- Then submit your PR.

If you fix a bug:

- If you are resolving a special issue, please add `fix: #<issue number> <short message>` in your PR title (e.g.`fix: #3899 update entities encoding/decoding`).
- Provide a detailed description of the bug in your PR and/or link to the issue. You can also include screenshots.

### Where should I start?

A good way to start to find an issue flagged as a `bug`, `help wanted` or `feature request`. The `good first issue` issues are good for newcomers. Please discuss the solution for larger issues first and after the final solution is approved by the MarkText members, you can submit/work on the PR. For small changes you can directly open a PR.
